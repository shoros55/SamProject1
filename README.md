# SamProject1
My project is called SamProject.  It is a user friendly, streamlined program designed to be used by my work at an interior plant leasing company.  This App's function is to be able to call on local plant availability database for ordering purposes.  The user can search for the specific plant and size desired and quickly return a list of nurseries with availability.

# How to start the app:
Please use the link below to launch the App.  
After launching the webapp, first select your desired region.  Then select the desired plant and size and click 'Enter' to search for nurseries with seasonal availability.<br />

# Tutorial:
For example select the Region radio button labeled "Miami-Dade".<br />
Then select "Aglo (Siam)" in the drop down menu.<br />
Then select "10"" in the drop down menu.<br />
Then click "Enter".<br />
The results of your search will populate under the heading "Availability" in the main panel.<br />
<br />
Now try again for Region "Palm Beach". (Availability is much more limited here, so begin with the following search).<br />
First select the Region radio button labeled "Palm Beach."<br />
Select "Adonidia Palm (Single)" in the drop down menu.<br />
Select "14"" in the drop down menu.<br />
Click "Enter".
