# SamProject1
My project is called SamProject.  It is a user friendly, streamlined program designed to be used by my work at an interior plant leasing company.  This App's function is to be able to call on local plant availability database for ordering purposes.  The user can search for the specific plant and size desired and quickly return a list of nurseries with availability.
